# Eye-Controlled-Mouse
Eye tracking technology, which is based on an eye tracker that measures the 
movement and positions of the eye has played an increasingly important role in psychology, 
marketing , and user interfaces. Eye trackers have existed for a number of years, but, early 
in the development of the field of eye tracking, the use of eye trackers was largely confined 
to laboratory experiments to observe the nature of human eye movements, rather than to 
use these movements as an actual control medium within a human-computer interaction 
(HCI) . Because the cost of eye trackers was around 30,000 a decade ago, it was too 
expensive to consider use in real user-computer interfaces. In recent years, with the 
development of better and cheaper components for gaze interaction, low-cost eye trackers 
have been produced by several high-profile companies, such as Tobii’s EyeX tracker , 
GazePoint’s GP3 tracker , and the Eye Tribe Tracker . As eye tracking gear gets cheaper, 
new applications with the concept of using eye tracking in HCI are clearly beginning to 
blossom.
